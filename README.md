## Step-00 Prepare requirements

You should manually install the following requirements:

+ Miktex : for LaTeX text support when drawing plots
+ Python : version 3.12 (e.g., 3.12.9) â€” specified to ensure compatibility beyond maintenance period
+ VScode (recommended) : an easy-to-use IDE
+ Git (optional) : for version control

## Step-01 Prepare the virtual environment for Python

Before creating the virtual environment, it is recommended to rename the root folder **"PIVdataProcessor"** to something more meaningful, such as **"PIV\_for\_Gundam"**.
After the virtual environment is created, neither its name nor its location (path) should be modified.

```
py -3.12 -m venv pivdataprocessor
```
