# 0. Introduction

This is the workspace of PIVdataProcessor.

# 1. Installation

## Step-01 Prepare requirements

You should manually install the following requirements:

+ Miktex : for LaTeX text support when drawing plots
+ Python : version 3.12 (e.g., 3.12.9) â€” specified to ensure compatibility beyond maintenance period
+ VScode (recommended) : an easy-to-use IDE
+ Git (optional) : for version control

## Step-02 Prepare the source files of pivdataprocessor

If you have Git installed, you can proceed as follows:

In the location where you want to start your PIV data processing,
right-click and open a command terminal, then run the following command:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sin390/PIVdataProcessor.git
```

If you prefer not to use Git, you can download the ZIP file from the following link:

```html
https://github.com/sin390/PIVdataProcessor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

## Step-03 Prepare the virtual environment for Python

Before creating the virtual environment, it is recommended to rename the root folder **"PIVdataProcessor"** to something more meaningful, such as **"PIV\_for\_Gundam"**.
After the virtual environment is created, neither its name nor its location (path) should be modified.

```
py -3.12 -m venv pivdataprocessor
```

## Other notes

The PIVdataProcessor is now ready to be used.

Note that Miktex may request to download missing packages.
